# üëã About Me

Hi! I'm Felipe Torres, a passionate Fullstack Software Engineer from Brazil. I've worked across diverse domains‚Äîfrom HealthTech to EdTech, and from internal tools to scalable platforms‚Äîdelivering impactful digital products that improve real-world processes.

üß† I enjoy designing systems, building reliable APIs, crafting intuitive interfaces, and mentoring developers. I‚Äôve led teams, launched full products, and contributed to platforms that serve thousands of users.

üöÄ Currently, I‚Äôm working on **Quoti**, a low-code platform empowering organizations to build custom internal systems with flexibility and speed. I also contribute to **OperAI**, where we optimize surgical scheduling through AI.

‚ö° Fun fact: I once dreamt of being a professional swimmer! üèäüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
